# The issue with your code lies in the way you've defined the `property`
# methods. You've nested the `setter` and `deleter` definitions **inside** the
# `x` getter method. This means they are locally scoped to that getter and won't
# be recognized as the property's setter and deleter.

# Here's the corrected code:

class Foo:
    def __init__(self, x=None):
        self._x = x

    @property
    def x(self):
        return self._x or 0

    @x.setter
    def x(self, value):
        self._x += value

    @x.deleter
    def x(self):
        self._x = 0
        # del self._x  # Optional: If you want to completely remove the attribute

foo = Foo(10)
print(foo.x)  # Output: 10
del foo.x
print(foo.x)  # Output: 0
foo.x = 10
print(foo.x)  # Output: 10 

# **Explanation:**

# 1. **Property Decorators:**  We use the `@property`, `@x.setter`, and
# `@x.deleter` decorators to define the getter, setter, and deleter methods for
# the `x` property, respectively.

# 2. **Correct Indentation:** The `setter` and `deleter` are now at the same
# indentation level as the `property` getter, making them part of the `x`
# property definition.

# 3. **Setter Logic:**  The setter (`@x.setter`) now correctly increments the
# value of `self._x` by the provided `value`.

# 4. **Deleter Logic:** The deleter (`@x.deleter`) sets `self._x` back to 0. You
# can uncomment `del self._x` if you want to completely remove the `_x`
# attribute instead of just resetting it.

# Now the code will function as intended, allowing you to get, set, and delete
# the `x` property of the `Foo` object.
